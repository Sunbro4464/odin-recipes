    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Fluffy and tasty classic breakfast food, known and loved across the world!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, potentially more as needed</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed.</li>
            <li>Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.</li>
            <li>Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.</li>
        </ol>
